Feedforward Neural Network for Binary Classification in Bank dataset.
There are 9 Machine Learning Methods, 2 Preprocessing techniques, and Feedforward Neural Network using TF and keras Sequential Dense Layers. Data source and citations are provided within the file.
For optimal results please use colab (Link) as runtime environment.
I would like to thank my professor sir Francis, Chief DS Megaworld Corp. for the mentorship, FCC, and TF. Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m-bERdjaq5RXPX1gkkGUXsfjS_yG3AbK?usp=sharing
